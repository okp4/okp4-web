      OKP4 is a general-purpose Ecosystem that enables <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service'>XaaS</a> (Anything as a Service) integration. Anything that is <br>
      presented to the Protocol as a Service, whatever it does, wherever it is hosted or deployed, whoever provides it, <br>
      can be used by the Protocol. Therein lies the integration power of the protocol, which brings infinite scalability <br>
      and extensibility to the distributed Dataverse.
