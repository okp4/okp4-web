      OKP4 is a general-purpose Ecosystem that enables <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service'>XaaS</a> (Anything as a Service) integration. Anything that is presented to the Protocol as a Service, whatever it does, wherever it is hosted or deployed, whoever provides it, can be used by the Protocol. Therein lies the integration power of the protocol, which brings infinite scalability and extensibility to the distributed Dataverse.
