    header: build Zones
    description: Define any rules. Share any Data & Services within it. Build powerful value-generating applications while keeping complete sovereignty over anything shared.

  purposes:
    header: Zones purposes
    descriptions:
      - OKP4 enables anyone to create and join Zones. A Zone is a set of custom rules applied to datasets and services shared within it, to generate value out of them.
      - "Rules can be applied to anything: business models, identity management, metadata requirements for shared data & services…"
      - This way, a Zone gives a predictable environment for the interaction of data and services (algorithms, computing resources, etc.) shared by the participants to build applications on top of them.

  share:
    header: share anything as a service
    description: Datasets, algorithms, software, storage, computation, identity management services… Any digital resource can be shared through metadata within one or many Zones defined in the OKP4 blockchain.

  header: build in trust and custom governance
  cards:
    - header: Easily define governance rules
      description: OKP4 enables frictionless Zone creation in a personalized, sovereign, secure and predictable environment. Anyone can easily leverage no-code interfaces and Zone templates! All rules are customizable in every aspect.
      alt: New Document Icon - OKP4
    - header: Define any kind of governance
      description: A Zone can have any governance mechanism to change its rules. It can mint its own governance token, leverage any existing token, be controlled by consortiums or even single entities.
      alt: New Document Setting Icon - OKP4
    - header: Build applications based on resources shared within Zones
      description: Once rules are defined and resources are pooled, participants can easily initiate workflows using the datasets and services of the Zone. The outputs of these workflows can be used in any application.
decentralizedProtocol:
  header: based on a decentralized protocol
  descriptions:
    - OKP4 is a decentralized and open-source protocol based on a public blockchain.
    - Zones are defined within on-chain smart contracts, enabling the interaction of any off-chain resource.
